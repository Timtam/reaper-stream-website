<p>This is the landing page for Scott's meet-ups about REAPER accessibility. You're probably seeing this page instead of cool stuff because there's nothing happening at the moment.</p>
<p>If you're sure something is starting right now, your browser might be displaying a cached version of the page by mistake. Hit refresh, that should get you back on track.</p>
<h2>Next Meet-up: Saturday 25th February, 8PM UK, 3PM Eastern.</h2>
<p>Join Scott and JennyK for "I'm Perplexed, What's Next?", an open Q&A for newcomers. Questions big and small about REAPER, OSARA or anything else around accessible recording are welcome.</p>
<h2>Even if you can't make it along, you can send us a question.</h2>
<p>There's no such thing as a single time that'll suit everyone all over the world, so to tide us over (just until  time travel becomes affordable), we've got a form where you can send us a question.</p>
<p>Please only use this form if you won't be able to attend live. We'll record the part  where we answer questions sent in this way, and release the recordings on RWP soon after each meet-up.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.office.com/r/T6wuYY7jE1">Go here to ask your question.</a></p>
