<title>REAPER Accessibility Q&A for newcomers</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>We're online! All systems are go (so far as we know)</h1>
<p>Welcome to Februrary’s edition of I’m Perplexed, What’s Next? If you’re new to REAPER, this is where you can ask questions. Literally anything that’s on your mind related to REAPER, OSARA or anything around accessible recording, we’ll be happy to help.</p>
<p>Jumping by heading will move through the various ways you can get in on the action.</p>
<h2>First, let's get the stream going</h2>
<p>Choose how you want to listen:</p>
<p><a href="https://laca.borris.me/reaperlive"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Listen to the stream on mobile</a></p>
<p><a href="https://laca.borris.me/reaperlive.m3u"rel="noopener">Open the stream in your default media player</a></p>
<h2>Wanna ask a question?</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get a question to us is by using the accessible chat right here in your browser</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.toni-barth.online"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Join the text chat to type questions</a></p>
<p>If you've got a microphone hooked up (or if your device has one in-built), you can also hop on TeamTalk with us in three easy-ish steps. Here's how:</p>
<ol><li>If you're using Windows or Mac, <a href="https://bearware.dk/?page_id=353"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download and install TeamTalk</a></li>
<li>If you're on a mobile device, search your Appstore for TeamTalk.</li>
<li>Once you've got TeamTalk installed, <a href="https://reaper.toni-barth.online/REAPER%20Made%20Easy%20-%20Join%20Live%20Streams.tt"rel="noopener">Click here to get a TT file that'll drop you straight into the channel with us<./a></li></ol>
<h2>We're live on YouTube as well!</h2>
<p>We're streaming audio live on YouTube as well. Listening in that way has a bit more of a delay, but hey, if none of the options above have worked out for you, this one probably will.</p>
<p>Hit the Play button below to listen on YouTube. Note that at the moment, we don't monitor YouTube live chat, please use the option further up the page instead to reach us.</p>
<h3>Credits and Support</h3>
<p>Huge thanks to TGV Productions for sponsoring these live streams, to Toni Barth for the back-end bolstering, to Patrick Perdue for the Icecast stream, and to Day Garwood for the TeamTalk server. You wouldn't be hearing us at all if it weren't for the genorosity and favours from these fineest of folk.</p>
