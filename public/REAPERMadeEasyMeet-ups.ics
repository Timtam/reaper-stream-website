 lad Sound will be in the hotseat\, walking us through how\nhe handled a com
 mission from our resident podcaster JennyK. He was given the\nvocal element
 s and script for a magical realism style scene featuring a\nnon-human chara
 cter\, asked to design the audio environment and enrich the story.\nWe'll b
 e taking an in depth look at his processes from the get-go to the let-go\,\
 nhe'll be doing some live tweaks according to Jen's notes\, and at the end 
 of the\nstream\, we'll compare what Justin cooked up to Jen's homebrew vers
 ion that was\nput together shortly after she finished writing the dialog. I
 f you've ever\nwondered about what a dedicated sound designer adds to a pro
 ject\, or been\ncurious about what it might be like to have a sound designe
 r bring your writing\nto life\, this is the place to get some insight into 
 what happens.
