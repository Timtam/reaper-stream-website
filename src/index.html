<p>This is the landing page for Scott's meet-ups about REAPER accessibility. You're probably seeing this page instead of cool stuff because there's nothing happening at the moment.</p>
<p>If you're sure something is starting right now, your browser might be displaying a cached version of the page by mistake. Hit refresh, that should get you back on track.</p>
<h2>Next Meet-up: Saturday 25th February, 8PM UK, 3PM Eastern.</h2>
<p>Join Scott and JennyK for "I'm Perplexed, What's Next?", an open Q&A for newcomers. Questions big and small about REAPER, OSARA or anything else around accessible recording are welcome.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of options to listen remotely and chat with us via text, but if you'd like to join in by voice, you'll need a free accessible app called TeamTalk.</p>
<p><a href="https://reaperteacher.com/TTQuickstart.html">Here's a bunch of tips that'll help if you've never used TeamTalk before.</a></p>
<h2>If you can't make it along, you can still send us a question.</h2>
<p>There's no such thing as a single time that'll suit everyone all over the world, so to tide us over (just until  time travel becomes affordable), we've got a form where you can send us a question.</p>
<p>Please only send questions this way if you won't be able to attend live. We'll record the part  of the meet-up where we answer questions sent in from people who couldn't make it, then post a recording on RWP soon after each meet-up.</p>
