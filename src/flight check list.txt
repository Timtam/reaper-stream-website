1. Open OBS, hit "Start streaming" check box, choose "Manage Broadcast", fill out meta data, then hit "Save and start streaming" button to go live on YouTube.
2. Load YouTube in browser, click "Your Videos" tab, click "Live", choose video in table, expand details, then search page for Video Link.
Note: you want the embed link, not the live one. Format looks like this:
www.youtube.com/embed/blah
3. Insert the embed URL into src/config.json. Note that if it's been quicker to get the live URL on clipboard, you can just change /live/blah to /embed/blah after pasting.
4. Do npm start to check everything compiles locally. Put localhost:3000/live in browser address bar to see the live page.
Note: if using Firefox to preview, load a new instance of the browser, hopping pages doesn't seem to work in the same instance. It does in Chrome though.
5. git commit the updated URL once everything seems right, then git push.
6. Go live on IceCast.
