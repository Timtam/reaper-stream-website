    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is the landing page for Scott's live streams about REAPER accessibility. You're probably seeing this page instead of cool stuff because there's no stream happening at the moment.</p>
<p>If you're sure we're supposed to be online, your browser might be displaying a cached version of the page by mistake. Hit refresh, that should persuade it to show you what's happening right now.</p>
<h2>Next scheduled stream:</h2>
"I'm Perplexed. What's Next?" a Q&A session for newcomers hosted by Scott and JennyK will be happening on Saturday February 4th, 8PM UK, 3PM Eastern.
