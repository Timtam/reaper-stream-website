        REAPER Made Easy: Free Training from TGV Productions

        REAPER is an accessible and affordable digital audio workstation (DAW). It can be used to compose, record, edit, mix and master pretty much any musical or audio-based thing you could name.
        In  this feed, you’ll find an expanding collection of free training content, all tailored toward using REAPER with screen reader software. We’re calling it the REAPER Made Easy project.
