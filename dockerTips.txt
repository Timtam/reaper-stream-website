Building and testing podcast yaml and ReaperTeacher site locally:
1. Install Docker desktop and choose add to path during install wizard. Keep the docker Desktop app open when doing the following steps.
2. cd into reaper stream website repo.
3. If you don't need to see the site locally, IE if you've only changed the podcast yaml file, this will try to build a container called rme.
docker build . -t rme
Assuming that completes, you can push.
4. To use the site locally, build as per above, then do this to run a temporary container.
docker run --rm -p 8000:80 rme
Then open localhost:8000 in browser to use site.
5. Control+C in command prompt to kill the container. As we used the --rm argument, it'll be automatically deleted.
