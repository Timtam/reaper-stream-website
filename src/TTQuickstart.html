    <h1>Tips for getting TeamTalk up and running</h1>
<p>You're welcome to join us on TeamTalk during meet-ups. That way, you can chat with us using your voice and we'll likely be able to get deeper into the nitty gritty of what you're working toward.</p>
<p>If you don't already have TeamTalk, it's available for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux. Follow the steps below to get up and going.</p>
<h2>Mobile Platforms:</h2>
<p>Search for TeamTalk in whichever App Store you use, or if you're browsing this page on your device right now, here are links for the big two.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/id/app/teamtalk-5/id1069487751">TeamTalk on Apple's App Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.bearware.gui&hl=en_GB&gl=US&pli=1">TeamTalk on Google Play.</a></p>
<p>Once you've got TeamTalk installed on your device, come back to this page and <a href="https://reaperteacher.com/REAPER%20Made%20Easy%20-%20Join%20Live%20Streams.tt"rel="noopener">hit this link to join us in the channel.</a></p>
<h3>Tips for Improving Audio on Mobile:</h3>
<p>These tips were kindly contributed by our guy Piotr who uses iOS. So far as we know they hold up for Android too, but feel free to set us straight with more info if there are Android-specific things we should know.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the tweaks below are optional. This is a Q&A for folks who are learning the ropes, nobody is gonna judge if your audio is a bit shabby. :)</p>
<ol><li>If you're using a Bluetooth headset, you can turn on the option to use A2DP mode in TeamTalk settings. This will persuade TeamTalk to send the highest quality audio your headset can provide.</li>
<li>If you want to send stereo audio, make sure the voice preprocessing switch is off. This will turn off noise reduction and echo cancellation, so probably best not use it if you're joining us from your phone in a busy Starbucks.</li></ol>
<h2>Desktop Platforms (Windows, Mac and um, perhaps Linux?)</h2>
<ol><li><a href="https://bearware.dk/?page_id=353"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download and install TeamTalk (the page will open in a new tab).</a></li>
<li>You can choose which microphone TeamTalk should use by going to the Client menu, then Sound Configuration, then Input Devices.</li>
<li>To choose which output to use (ideally headphones or a headset), it's the Client menu again, Sound Configuration, Output Devices.</li>
<li>You can set your nickname by hitting F5. Probably best to use your actual name here so we can recognize you.</li>
<li>Once you've chosen those things, switch back to this page and <a href="https://reaperteacher.com/REAPER%20Made%20Easy%20-%20Join%20Live%20Streams.tt"rel="noopener">Click here to get a TT file that'll drop you straight into the channel with us.</a></li>
<li>When you're online, you can check what your own audio sounds like by moving to your name in the users list and pressing Control+4 on the top number row (Command+4 on Mac). It's a toggle, just press it again to stop hearing yourself.</li>
<li>If you find that you're only audible on one side, take one more trip into the Client menu, Sound Configuration, go down to Enable Echo Cancellation and hit Enter.</li>
<li>To toggle your microphone on and off, hit Control+Shift+A (that's Command+Shift+A on Mac). Feel free to keep your mic on when we're taking/answering your questions, then please turn yourself off whenever you're settling in to listen for a spell. It's easier for everyone if we all do our bit to keep the stream relatively clean.</li></ol>
