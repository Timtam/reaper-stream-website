 nth we're joined by guests Matt and Estelle\, a guitarist and vocalist who\
 nposted an acoustic arrangement they've recorded in the REAPER Access Whats
 App\ngroup. Although they're both relatively new to recording themselves wi
 th REAPER\,\nwe reckon they've captured lightning in a bottle\, so when it 
 turned out they\nboth had questions\, we figured meeting with them on a str
 eam would be a fun way\nto find them some answers. The song we'll be workin
 g on is a tasty brew of\nacoustic guitars\, clean electric and vocals\, eve
 rything recorded in home spaces.\nThis is likely gonna be an all-rounder ty
 pe session covering aspects of\nrecording\, editing\, mixing\, maybe a quic
 k dabble in mastering if we get time\,\nand of course\, plenty of Q&A along
  the way.
