<p>This is the landing page for Scott's live streams about REAPER accessibility. You're probably seeing this page instead of cool stuff because there's no stream happening at the moment.</p>
<p>If you're sure we're supposed to be online, your browser might be displaying a cached version of the page by mistake. Hit refresh, that should persuade it to show you what's happening right now.</p>
