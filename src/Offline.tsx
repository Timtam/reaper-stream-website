                We stream good quality audio in a bunch of places. Once a stream
                starts, there will be links to listen in most media players, you
                can chew the fat with us in real-time using a free accessible
                app called TeamTalk, or you can ask us questions in
                our YouTube chat, too.

                Any support you can send in goes toward paying Q&A hosts a reasonable hourly rate. We pay guest trainers who contribute to deep-dive sessions fairly as well.
                If you canâ€™t support financially, spreading the word that this resource is here is also much appreciated.
